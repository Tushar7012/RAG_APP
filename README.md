# 🔍 Advanced RAG Application (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This project implements an **Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application** using **LangChain, FastAPI, and a Hybrid Search (BM25 + FAISS)** approach for document retrieval. The system enhances **LLM responses** by incorporating relevant context from retrieved documents, improving accuracy and factual consistency.
